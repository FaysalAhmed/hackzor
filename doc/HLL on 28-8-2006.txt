                            ================
  	

0.1  Objectives
===============
   	The following modules will be implemented in version 0.10
  
  	
 		Registeration		   : With Minimal database design 
 		Code Submission		 : Full Implementation          
 		Compilation 		    : Optional Phase               
 		Evaluation 		     : Support All Languages        
 	                   
   	

0.2  Modules
============
   		It has been decided that Version 0.10 will have support for a
single Web sever with Multiple Evaluators that connect to it.
  	

0.2.1  Server Side
------------------
   		
  			
 - Get the File 			
 - Add to queue with meta data 			
 - Wait for Evaluators 			
 - UpdateDb with Results 		
   	

0.2.2  Evaluator
----------------
   		Evaluators will probably use some Encryption method to authenticate
themselves with the Web Server.
  		
  			
 - Connect to the Web Server 			
 - Choose the Job. The server is a passive member here and the Evaluator
   decides which job it will take up. 			
 - Compile if necessary 			
 - Execute 			
 - Log any info 			
 - Compare with author solution - It has been decided that the author
   would provide the solutions as Python RegEx for now, But this
   decision may change in the future 			
 - Return results
