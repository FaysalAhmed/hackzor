	* main.py (Question.save_eval_to_disk): This function will
	unpickle a file; the evaluator, sent from web server

2006-11-27  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* main.py: Removed dependancies on server application.  Added
	classes locally for Question, Attempt.
	(Questions): This is a class which contains the dictionary
	questions.
	(XMLParser): This class will be a base class providing functions
	for dealing with XML files (the basis for the distributed
	architecture)
	(Client): Removing queue_not_empty and dequeue_attempts since, the
	design of hackzor is to use a distributed one. These operations
	will be done at the web-server rather than the distributed
	evaluators. Threading has also been removed since we want the
	evaluator to evaluate only 1 attempt at a point of time.
