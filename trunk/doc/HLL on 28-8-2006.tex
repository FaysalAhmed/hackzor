\maketitle
	\subsection{Objectives}
	The following modules will be implemented in version 0.10 \\\\
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		Registeration		&: With Minimal database design\\
		Code Submission		&: Full Implementation\\
		Compilation 		&: Optional Phase\\
		Evaluation 		&: Support All Languages\\
	\end{tabular}
	\subsection{Modules}
		It has been decided that Version 0.10 will have support for a single Web sever with Multiple Evalutors that connect to it.\\
	\subsubsection{Server Side}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Get the File
			\item Add to queue with meta data
			\item Wait for Evaluators
			\item UpdateDb with Results
		\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Evaluator}
		Evaluators will probably use some Encryption method to authenticate themselves with the Web Server.\\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Connect to the Web Server
			\item Choose the Job. The server is a passive member here and the Evaluator decides which job it will take up.
			\item Compile if necessary
			\item Execute
			\item Log any info
			\item Compare with author solution - It has been decided that the author would provide the solutions as Python RegEx for now, But this decision may change in the future
			\item Return results
		\end{itemize}
