	* main.py (Evaluator.run): Removed calling Popen on ./exec.py and
	implemented explicit forking and exec. Added os.setpgrp() to the child to
	set the process group for cascading kills thereby, fixing TLE kills
	* exec.py: deleted and moved functionality into main.py

2008-02-01  Ravi Shankar <ravehanker@gmail.com>

	* settings.py: Removed SERVER_KEYID and added EVALUATOR_KEYID
	* main.py (XMLParser): Removing GPG object
	* main.py (XMLParser.dos2unix): Changed dos2unix to use string replace
	* main.py (XMLParser.decrypt): Removed function and it's corresponding
	calls in other methods
	* main.py (Client.__init__): Moving from GPG to simple key authentication
	* main.py: Removed commented function import_key

2007-05-16  Ravi Shankar <ravehanker@gmail.com>

	* main.py (XMLParser.decrypt, XMLParser.add_node
				Client.submit_attempt): Turning off encryption to fix build

2007-01-17  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* main.py: Implemented Logging functionality. Uses the logging
	module of Python. Fixes Issue #1
	(http://code.google.com/p/hackzor/issues/detail?id=1)

2007-01-16  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* main.py (Evaluator.run): Modified to return the
	tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile file object instead of the output as
	text. A small performance gain. We cannot directly return the
	tempfile.file object since this closes the file.
	(Evaluator.is_compiled): This function was added so that the
	object files of the compiled Languages can be removed after
	execution while the interpreted language files remain to be
	archived on disk.	
	(Evaluator.run): Additional Memory and/or Time can be provided on
	a per language basis
	(Client): Scoring logic pushed back to server. Removed score
	function

2006-12-26  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* main.py (Question.save_eval_to_disk): Fixed the addition of
	'\r's during pickling
	(Evaluator.run): Fixed TLE killing of processes. More work to be
	done here

2006-12-15  Ravi Shankar <ravehanker@gmail.com>

	* main.py (Attempt.convert_to_result): Made Error Msg Passing Mandatory

2006-12-04  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* main.py (Evaluator.run): Added reporting of SIGSEGV, SIGKILL and
	SIGTERM

2006-12-03  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* main.py (XMLParser.obj): Added global GPG object called obj
	(XMLParser.decrypt): Added Decrypt function (based on PGP)
	(XMLParser.get_val_by_id): Automatically returns decrypted values
	now
	(Client.__init__): KeyID obtained from keyring now
	(Client.obj): Added global GPG object called obj
	(Client.import_key): Added function to import keys
	(Client.submit_attempt): Submits an XML attempt after signing

2006-11-29  Ravi Shankar  <ravehanker@gmail.com>

	* main.py(save_eval_to_disk): fixed misspelt variable 'evaluators'

	(Client.__init__): Added '/' to urls
	(Client.submit_attempt): Fixed misspelt variableo\

	(Client.start): Added Temporary hack to catch 404
2006-11-29  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* main.py (Question.save_input_to_disk): Input Data is not saved
	to file as soon as Client gets question set. This will optimise in
	that the file need not be saved and read on each attempt
	evaluation.
	(Evaluator.run): Run the user program using a wrapper file --
	exec.py. Memory limits, time limits now implemented.
	(Python_Evaluator.get_run_cmd): Changed exec command from
	explicitly stating python. User programs should now have the
	shebang line
	(Python_Evaluator.compile): Compiling only effects it to giving
	execute permission to the python script
	(Evaluator.check): Corrected the Check function to send the output
	to the evaluator

	* exec.py: Added exec.py as a wrapper function caller. This file
	will set the Limits and constraints. So, the limits will apply
	only to the executed program. Have added Memory
	constraint. Maximum number of open files constraint does not work.

	* main.py (Question.save_eval_to_disk): This function will
	unpickle a file; the evaluator, sent from web server

2006-11-27  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* main.py: Removed dependancies on server application.  Added
	classes locally for Question, Attempt.
	(Questions): This is a class which contains the dictionary
	questions.
	(XMLParser): This class will be a base class providing functions
	for dealing with XML files (the basis for the distributed
	architecture)
	(Client): Removing queue_not_empty and dequeue_attempts since, the
	design of hackzor is to use a distributed one. These operations
	will be done at the web-server rather than the distributed
	evaluators. Threading has also been removed since we want the
	evaluator to evaluate only 1 attempt at a point of time.
	
2006-11-19  Ravi Shankar <ravehanker@gmail.com>

	* main.py : Added doc strings to classes

	* main.py (Evaluator.run): Changed the way the method kills the subprocess

	* main.py (Client.evaluate): Fixed the Multiple-Submit Scoring Bug
	
	* main.py (Client.run): Moved attempt's result-updation code to
	Client.evaluate

2006-11-18  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* main.py (Client.run): Setting the evaluator ruling in the Attempt.

2006-10-29  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* evaluator/main.py (Evaluator.run): Corrected the TLE function to
	actually kill the program itself and not just the shell.
	Added Piping of Input and output directly from the program and not
	from shell

2006-10-27  Prashanth Mohan  <prashmohan@gmail.com>

	* evaluator/main.py (Client.evaluate): Added Saving the Score! Was
	a Bug.
